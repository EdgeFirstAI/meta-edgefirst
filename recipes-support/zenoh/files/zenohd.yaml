# Zenoh router configuration for EdgeFirst.  The zenohd service is setup to run
# as a router and listen on the localhost interface on port 7447.  EdgeFirst
# services connect to the zenohd service on the localhost interface in
# client-only mode.
#
# To allow remote connections update the listen endpoint to tcp/0.0.0.0:7447.
#
# To forward services to another device configure the connect endpoint, e.g.
# "tcp/1.2.3.4:7447".
